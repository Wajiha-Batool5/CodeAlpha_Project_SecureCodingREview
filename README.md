# Secure Coding Review Project

## Overview

This project focuses on performing a secure coding review of a network sniffer application implemented in Python using the Scapy library. The goal is to identify potential security vulnerabilities and recommend best practices for secure coding.

## Project Components

- **Network Sniffer**: A Python application that captures and analyzes network packets.
- **Secure Coding Review**: A comprehensive review document outlining identified vulnerabilities and recommendations for improvement.

## Features

- Real-time packet capture and logging.
- Identification of TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets.
- Logging of source and destination IP addresses.
- Recommendations for secure coding practices.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Scapy library
- Elevated privileges (root or admin access) to capture packets
